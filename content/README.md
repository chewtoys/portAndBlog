# How to add a blog

1. Created the \_\_\_.md file in the directory in which you wish the blog be posted (gaming or coding)
2. Add an object to the corresponding array in the store
3. If image used, add to 'static' directory and add path to config for after static (ex. '/images/ex.jpg')

## Notes
- I now have this setup where the routes are automatically generated and even added to the sitemap so no extra work is needed there.
- "image" property now needs to be in array format so it will work in the carousel.
