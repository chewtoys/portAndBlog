Gone are the days of simply buying a new game with a specific game publisher logo on the box and knowing you will enjoy the game when you get home. Since the addition of storage and internet connectivity to game consoles occurred, buying a AAA game has become more of a crapshoot. Games will often launch in an incomplete state needing patches for bug fixes and feature adds down the road. Sometimes a game launches with the bare minimum feature set and asks the player to open their wallet again to unlock more features or items. Any way you look at it, AAA games have become a bit of a nasty business in 2019.
