So you want to buy a new console for your collection? That’s cool, but do you know which version of that console you want? Do you know what the differences are between the various models and revisions?

Buying a new console always makes for an exciting day as a collector. It isn’t as simple an easy as finding the console you want at a decent price though. Many video game consoles have different models and revisions with different feature sets and strengths. Before you just go out and buy a new console, you should know which model or revision best suits your needs. Today I will try to provide some information on the more common consoles to help you make those decisions. Note that I will be focused on which models are best for playing games in the US.

If I pick up a new console that isn’t on this list I might circle back and add my new findings/research to it.

## Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)

The first console from Nintendo, the NES as it is so commonly known, only had two different models and is Nintendo's 8-bit home console offering. The differences are minimal other than their appearance.

- The front loader NES is the most iconic, most reliable, and has RCA/composite outputs along with the standard RF output.
- The top loader NES came later. It is rarer, less reliable, and only sports the RF output which makes it a little more difficult to play on modern TVs.
<br><br>

Basically, you are better off buying the front loader if your intention is to play NES games. The top loader is collectible, though, so if you are a collector you might consider getting a top loader as well.

<b>What do I have?</b> I have a front loader connected via composite cables.

## Sega Master System

The Sega Master System was Sega’s 8-bit console intended to compete with the NES. In the US, we had two main models available with a fair amount of differences to note.

- The Master System Mark III (model 1) was the first model released. It was a bit larger than the other model due in part to the fact it included a game card reader along with the standard cartridge slot. It also has RGB video output without modification.
- The Master System II was a cost-reduced version released later that was smaller but lacks the card reader slot. It does not output RGB without modification, is not compatible with the 3D Sega Scope Glasses, and has compatibility issues with a few Master System cartridge games. The Master System II also has a door that slides closed over the game cartridge slot. This door wears out easily and is likely to break.
<br><br>

If you want to get the full Master System experience and/or have the best video output quality, then the Mark III (model 1) is definitely the way to go. The only real reason to pick up the Master System II, other than for the sake of collecting, is to have a Master System take up less space on your shelves.

<b>What do I have?</b> At the time of this writing I don't yet own a Master System, but I have researched them a bit and hope to get one soon. I will definitely be getting a Master System III (model 1) sometime soon.

## Sega Genesis

The Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside of the US) was Sega's 16-bit home console and had four different models with some fairly substantial differences to note. Which model is best for you highly depends on what you are after.

- The model 1 has the best quality audio output. It allows for playing Master System games with the use of the Power Base Converter and 32X and Sega CD games with the addition of the necessary add-ons. The Sega CD add-on that is meant for the model 1 is harder to find and more pricey, but it can be used with the Sega CD model 2 and will just hang off the edges of the Sega CD model 2’s base a bit. It can also output RGB without modification allowing for a better picture when connected with a component or SCART cable to an upscaler.
- The model 2 is smaller and doesn’t have the HD audio output of the model 1, but still sounds fairly good. It can also be used with the Power Base Converter, 32X, and Sega CD add-ons like the model 1 although the Power Base Converter has to be slightly modified to fit. Like the model 1, the model 2 outputs RGB without modification but has a slightly smaller output adapter so make sure you get the correct cable.
- The model 3 Genesis is a lot rarer than the other models, but that comes at a cost. It is much smaller, less reliable, does not output RGB without modification, and will not connect with ANY of the Genesis add-ons so Genesis games are all you will play with the model 3. That being said, it also isn’t compatible with Genesis games containing a DSP chip so your selection of Genesis games will even be a little restricted.
- The CDX is a small version of the Genesis that comes with a cartridge slot for Genesis games and a disc drive for Sega CD games built in. Unfortunately, it will not connect to the Power Base Converter or 32X add-ons, although I have seen where someone has modded a CDX to work with the 32X before. These are highly collectible and expensive compared to the other models, but they are less reliable.
<br><br>

If you just want to play Genesis games, any of these models will work but I recommend the model 1 or model 2 for reliable reasons. If you are interested in collecting the Genesis add-ons then the model 1 and model 2 are your only choices, although if you aren’t interested in the 32X then the CDX is a fair option because it has the Sega CD functionality built in. The CDX is the most valuable and collectible if that is what you are after.

<b>What do I have?</b> I have a model 2 with a 32X plugged in connected to an upscaler via a SCART cable.

## Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)

The SNES has 2 models, but the first model has many revisions. Both models have their strengths and weaknesses so knowing which one to get is based on your intended use.

</div>

- The original SNES model does RGB output without modification. The original SNES had many revisions and any revision will be fine for the casual collector or gamer who wants a SNES and might want to connect it with an RGB cable at some point. For the hardcore folks out there that want the best possible picture quality with no compromises, you have to open the console and check to see if it is a “1Chip” revision. I attached a picture above to show what to look for. Note that the number after “1Chip” is a revision and that number doesn’t have an effect on the picture quality.
- The SNES Jr. has better composite/RCA and s-video output quality than the original. It is also smaller and less likely to turn yellow like the original. That said, it does not output RGB without modification.
<br><br>

If you have no intention of dealing with RGB output then go for a SNES Jr. Otherwise, get the original and if you REALLY want stellar output quality look for the “1Chip” revisions.

<b>What do I have?</b> I have an original "1Chip" revision connected to an upscaler via a SCART cable.

## Sega Saturn

The Sega Saturn has 2 models, both of which are identical on the outside. The model MK-80000A has a very slight improvement in picture quality over the model MK-80000, but not enough to justify looking for a former if you already own the latter. Both models output RGB without modification.

<b>What do I have?</b> I have a MK-80000 connected to an upscaler via a SCART cable.

## Sony PlayStation

The original PlayStation saw several models released during its life span. There are definitely some major differences and things to look out for with these too. Make sure to get the model that best suits your intended use!

While some models have physical differences you can see, you still need to check the model number to properly identify a PlayStation console.

Because the PlayStation has so many options for connection types, I’ll take a second to explain why you might want a certain connection type before listing off the different models and their details.
* <b>RCA/composite</b> - This connection would allow you to connect a PlayStation to your TV with the common yellow, red, and white composite cables that used to be used to connect everything to your TV.
* <b>Parellel port</b> - While these have some interesting uses, the primary reason the average person would want to have a PlayStation with a parallel port is to plug in a GameShark or Action Replay. Also, it can be used if you modify your PlayStation with a <a href="https://ps-io.com/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">PSIO</a> for playing PS1 ROMS instead of using CDs (like a flash cart).
* <b>Serial Port</b> - These are used to connect two PlayStations together to allow enable multi-player modes on select games. Note that each PlayStation has to be plugged into a separate TV.﻿
* <b>AV Multi-Out</b> - These are used for plugging in the PlayStation video cables and pass the audio and video signal to various connection types on the other end.
<br><br>

Now for the details of each model:

- SCPH-1000 to SCPH-5003 were the first models and have some definite weaknesses and strengths. These all had a parallel port, serial port, AV multi-out, and RCA/composite outs. No other models have that many connections on it so these models definitely win in that way. These models can also be modded for digital audio output. On the other hand, these models also had plastic CD drive parts that warp easily when the console gets too hot which results in problems when trying to play games. The SCPH-1000 to SCPH-1003 have the best analog audio quality of all PlayStation models.
- SCPH-5500 to SCPH-7503 has the same connection types as the earlier models except for the composite/RCA connections. They also had metal disc drive parts and are not prone to the warping issue the earlier models have.
- SCPH-7000 to SCPH-7002 is a special release midnight blue edition. These are the rarest except for some debugging models.
- SCPH-100 to SCPH-103 are the slim versions and removed all connections except power and AV multi-out. These are labeled "PSone” and there is a screen add-on that can be purchased for them to allow for playing on the go (as long as you can plug into a wall outlet).
- Debugging kits are much harder to find and cost substantially more. They come in either blue or green and can play burned discs are they were intended for use by game developers.
- The “Net Yaroze” model is a special edition debugging model that was black and lacked some of the more advanced features of the other debugging models. They are also very rare and expensive.
<br><br>

Also, the last digit of the PlayStation model number indicates the country for which that model was created:

* 0 for Japan
* 1 for North America
* 2 for PAL/Europe
* 3 for Asia
<br><br>

<b>What do I have?</b> I don't yet have a PlayStation, but I plan on getting one soon. Right now I use my PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 to play PlayStation games. I will likely try to get a SCPH-7501 as I would like to have the parallel port, don't want the problems with the plastic disc drive parts, and would like the newest model with those features for the sake of longevity.

## Nintendo 64 (N64)

To the average collector or casual retro gamer, the differences in models of the N64 doesn’t really matter. Other than color, the differences only matter if you plan on modifying your N64 for RGB, but even then it is kind of moot as all N64s can be modded in this way. The difference comes down to which mod kit you have to buy. Basically, there is a basic kit and an advanced kit. The advanced kit is more difficult to install. Rather than list a bunch of model numbers, I’ll leave you this link if you are interested in this topic: <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/n64rgbcompatible.html" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://www.retrorgb.com/n64rgbcompatible.html</a>

<b>What do I have?</b> I have a Funtastic Teal NUS-001 from Japan that is region modded to also play US games, RGB modded, and has a special “de-blur” mod. It is connection to an upscaler via <a href="https://www.hdretrovision.com/snes" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">HD Retrovision SNES component cables</a>.

## Sega Dreamcast

The Sega Dreamcast only had 2 models released in the US: the regular white model and the all black "Sega Sports Edition" other than appearance, there are no internal differences in Dreamcast models to be concerned with.

<b>What do I have?</b> I have the original white model plugged into an upscaler via a VGA cable.

## Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2)
