Any person that has been a gamer for any significant amount of time will have opinions about what their favorite game franchises are. If you’ve been gaming for a very long time, narrowing down your list of favorite game franchises to just 10 can prove to be a difficult task. To what criteria do you judge your favorites?
I had to sit down and think about my list of favorite game franchises for a while. I decided that I would judge my list according to the following criteria:

- Which franchises have made the biggest impact on gaming in my opinion?
- Which franchises have games that I’ve spent the most time playing?
- Which franchises have games that would end up on my top games of all time list?
- Which franchises do I have the most positive and/or nostalgic feelings toward?

Based on that list, I was able to cobble together a list of what I would call my favorite franchises of all time. We all have our own thoughts and opinions on this topic, but here is MY list of my favorite video game franchises to date (subject to change as more and more great games are released).

## 10) Grand Theft Auto

## 9) Mortal Kombat

## 8) Halo

## 7) Mario Kart

## 6) Call of Duty

## 5) God of War

## 4) Tony Hawk Pro Skater

## 3) Sonic the Hedgehog

## 2) Super Mario Bros

## 1) The Legend of Zelda

## That's All, Folks!
