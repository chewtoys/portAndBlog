Since “cutting the cord” somewhere around 8 years ago, I have found that I watch more and more YouTube. I started to figure out after a while that the more you follow and like channels and the better your suggestions became and the more enjoyable your YouTube experience becomes. It seems like common sense, but I was one of those folks who say YouTube as a place to do random searches instead of a place where I could have somewhat curated content show up.
After officially deeming myself a video game collector, I began to have questions like:

- How do I find good deals on games?
- How big of a collection do most collectors have?
- What are some desirable games, hardware, accessories, etc?
- What is the best way to connect old consoles to modern televisions?
- When does <insert game, console, or accessory> come out?
<br><br>
…and many other things.

I turned to YouTube for a lot of those answers at first and learned a lot. I also found that I particularly enjoyed videos from certain creators and I subscribed to their channels. As my feed filled with video game related content, I found more and more YouTubers I liked. My list of video game YouTubers grew enough I thought it might be a good idea to share that list with other collectors who might be interested.

I have decided on a small set of criteria to cover for each YouTuber to have a consistently formatted, brief summary of each channel. The points I will hit are:

- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> This is self explanitory.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> News, top ten lists, reviews, tutorials, etc.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> Hidden gems, getting the best picture from a retro console, how to find good deals, etc.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Could I see myself having a beer with them at a bar or just hanging out playing some video games with them? "Beerable" is a terrible term I picked up from a hiring manager in the tech world, but I decided to use it here regardless of my overall hatred for the term because it is easy an easy to understand concept. This is just personal opinion and based highly off of how well my personality might mesh with their personality and if I think they are they type of person/people for which I could see myself having fun.
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> Again, self explanitory.

## MetalJesusRocks

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEFymXY4eFCo_AchSpxwyrg" target="_blank" rel="external">MetalJesusRocks</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 676,956
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> 1 to 4 times a week
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> MJR’s content varies pretty widely covering subject matter like hidden gems, games top XX lists for consoles, casually playing games or going on adventures with his friends, traveling to see other collectors’ collections, new mods/console/accessories/etc, and more. 
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I’ve honestly sat on my couch with my laptop open taking notes while watching some of his top XX games and hidden gems videos. I seem to have similar tastes in games and his knowledge of game libraries for some consoles runs deep. I also have found value in some of his videos covering new console accessories, cables, etc and have even made purchases based on his coverage.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Absolutely! He likes metal, collects video games, plays guitar, likes to drink and have a good time, and appears to be close to the same age as me.  
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> My only real critique of his channel is that sometimes his videos run a little long for my taste. I tend to consume shorter videos in high quantities and a 30+ minute video isn’t always what I’m seeking, although I do sometimes circle back to those long videos when the timing is right.

## RGT 85

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA5RGaQc-a8tIX_AqTTmWdw" target="_blank" rel="external">RGT 85</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 215,550
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> Daily, sometimes multiple times a day.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Mainly gaming news and reviews, but sometimes he posts other types of content as well.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I mostly get current game news, rumors about upcoming games or consoles, and reviews on modern games and hardware from RGT 85’s channel. We seem reasonably like-minded so if he likes something then I usually know I should dig deeper to see if it is something I would like
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Yup! 
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> I really enjoy RGT 85’s content, but the little nit-pick I have is that he butchers the English language sometimes. It isn’t a huge deal and doesn’t detract from his content, but his misuse of words drives me a little crazy. I know and love lots of people that are not wordsmiths (I might fall into that category with other people), but I always quietly cringe a little when I hear words used incorrectly.

## Spawn Wave

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoIXnB865l9Ex9zs4OIXTdQ" target="_blank" rel="external">Spawn Wave</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 298,268
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> Daily, sometimes multiple times a day.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Gaming news and rumors, unboxing and reviews on gaming related purchases he makes, and general coverage of modern gaming events. 
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I watch Spawn Wave’s channel a lot mostly to get modern gaming news. He also does videos where he might, for example, by a refurbished console or selection of games from Game Stop then unboxes and takes a dive into what he really received. I find these types of videos useful because he knows the internals and failure points of game hardware well enough to tell you things like “don’t buy a refurbished Xbox 360 from Game Stop” and I use this information when making purchasing decisions.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> I think so, but he just became a father, and as a father myself I can tell you he isn’t going out to have drinks anytime soon (congrats, by the way)! 
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> As with the previous guys, I have no major complaints about Spawn Wave’s channel. If I have to say something it might be that he is a bit too serious or cold in his delivery at times.

## DidYouKnowGaming?

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DYKGaming" target="_blank" rel="external">DidYouKnowGaming?</a>

- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> History and trivia about retro games, game series, consoles, and more.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I like watching DidYouKnowGaming? because I learn lesser known, interesting facts about all things gaming. I especially enjoyed their whole series on the Zelda franchise.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Being they have different narrators who are presumably reading from a script, I can‘t really say.
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> Big surprise, I don‘t have any real complaints about this channel. If unusual and intersting facts about gaming is what you seek, then you will like this channel. It isn’t as fun as others on the list, but it scratches a different itch.<br><br>

## The 8-bit Guy

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/adric22" target="_blank" rel="external">The 8-bit Guy</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 923,762
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> About every 1 to 2 weeks.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Information, restoration, and DIY videos about classic gaming computers.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> The main thing I takeaway from The 8-bit Guy’s videos is knowledge on classic gaming computers. It is a topic for which I have a curiosity and occasionally enjoy learning more about.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Maybe?
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> The content is a little dry, but if you want solid information on classic gaming computers then you will find value in this channel.
<br><br>

## Scott the Woz

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/scottthewoz" target="_blank" rel="external">Scott the Woz</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 564,033
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> 1 to 3 times a week
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Scott the Woz’s videos cover a variety of gaming topics, but mostly you’ll opinions and facts and retro gaming topics. He has an interesting sense of humor that is present throughout all of his videos giving them a high entertainment value.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I don‘t really learn too much. Occasionally I’ll pick up an interesting fact about an old franchise or console, but mostly his channel is just entertaining.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> If he’s old enough to drink!
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> My only complaint about this channel is the amount of sexual innuendo and sexually related jokes. I don’t mind that kind of content when I’m expecting it, but I wasn’t expecting that to be such a theme in a lot of his videos and, after watching one of his videos recently, my 10-year-old son asked me what “getting laid” means. It isn’t offensive or anything, but if he would refrain from making sex jokes like a pent up teenager then his channel would be more family friendly and I wouldn’t hesitate to put them on with my son in the room.

## Girlfriend Reviews

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eEGT06FrWFU6VBnPOR9lg" target="_blank" rel="external">Girlfriend Reviews</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 464,586
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> Once a week.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Girlfriend Reviews is a channel run by a couple who like video games. Mostly, the videos are about what it is like to be the girlfriend of a guy playing <insert name of a game here>. Occasionally the narrator (the girlfriend) does a review of a game she played too.﻿﻿
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I don‘t really watch this channel to learn anything because it is just plain entertaining and funny. I do occasionally get ideas of games to play with my wife.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> This couple seems like they’d be a blast to hang out with!
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> I have none. Go in expecting humorous reviews on games from a different perspective and you’ll enjoy the content.

## Game Sack

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrGameSack" target="_blank" rel="external">Game Sack</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 216,892
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> Roughly once a week.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Joe and Dave from Game Sack cover a wide variety of retro gaming topics. You will find videos for clone system reviews, game reviews, game playthoughs, and “best game” lists.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I trust the reviews these two guys make and take them into strong consideration when deciding on a new clone console or retro game purchase. The force is strong with these two!
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Absolutely.
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> Their content is rich and a lot of the time educational, but the delivery is a little flat and boring sometimes. It doesn‘t bother me too much most of the time though.
<br><br>

## Pixel Game Squad

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRwh3TVQszgmDK6UHzHNdQQ" target="_blank" rel="external">Pixel Game Squad</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 26,727
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> 1 to 2 times a week
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Pixel Game Squad’s content consists mostly of a group of funny guys that collect retro games and toys going to swap meets, privately owned warehouses, Game Stop, or any other place they might find a good deal on something they collect. There’s bartering, shenanigans, and lots of kidding around.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I’ve gotten some good tips on how to get good deals from these guys. For example, just yesterday I went to the flea market searching for games and I carried a satchel so the vendors couldn‘t see that I was buying games and I knew to hold up a handful of games with the good ones in the back of the stack and say “how much for all of these”. Both are great tips I picked up watching this channel.﻿
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> These guys seem like a lot of fun, so yes!
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> Pixel Game Squad is a channel that doesn‘t take itself too seriously. It’s about having fun and meeting new people while on the search for new items for their collections. I have nothing at all negative to say!
<br><br>

## Digital Foundry

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="external">Digital Foundry</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 738,878
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> Every 1 to 2 days.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Digital Foundry kind of specializes in making videos about gaming graphics and performance. There are other elements to their videos, but they really dive deeply into topics like graphics comparisons with ray tracing vs without, how does a new game perform on a PS4 Pro vs a Xbox One X, reviews on new graphics cards, etc.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I usually just satisfy my curiosities with Digital Foundry’s content. Occasionally I pick up some useful information about graphics cards or a new HDMI mod for an older console.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Maybe? It’s hard to answer that when the content is so serious and you never see the narrators.
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> If you are looking for hardcore graphics comparisons and some very technically minded reviews, Digital Foundry is a channel worth checking out. Their videos can get a little long sometimes, but they are always full of information from start to finish.

## The Game Theorists

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MatthewPatrick13" target="_blank" rel="external">The Game Theorists</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 11,631,377
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> 1 to 2 times a week
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> It varies wildly, but in my opinion their best videos are their “Game Theory” series.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> While it isn’t the most useful knowledge, I’ve learned a little about the impossibility of video game physics when compared to real world physics.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> I think so.
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> A few months ago, The Game Theorists was cheated out of a substantial amount of income by their management company. While I think this type of thing is disgusting and I really feel bad for the channel, I feel like the content has gone downhill a bit since that has happened. They have since posted a number of videos regarding what it is like to be a YouTube channel, how they were ripped off, and the problems with YouTube itself. I find these videos interesting sometimes, but I didn’t subscribe to this channel to have these videos in my feed. Maybe this type of content would have been better suited for a second channel? Also, they do their “Game Theory” videos on a lot of games I couldn’t care less about. Still, I thoroughly enjoy the videos of theirs that I choose to watch, I just find that I’m not too interested in watching a lot of their content.

## Gamehut

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfVFSjHQ57zyxajhhRc7i0g" target="_blank" rel="external">Gamehut</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 113,291
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> 1 to 4 times a month.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Gamehut’s content scratches my gamer itch and my developer itch at the same time. The channel is narrated by someone who worked on a handful of popular games as a developer back in the 90s. Their content really shines light on how difficult it was to be a developer for hardware with such limited resources.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I’ve learned why it was so difficult to develop games for the Saturn, tricks developers used on to conserve memory so they can squeeze in more content, and a little bit about what it was likte to be a part of the team that made some classics from the 90s.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> I would love to sit down with the narrator and pick his brain about being a game developer in the 90s. Whether or not beer is present wouldn’t matter.
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> This channel might not be for everyone as it is more technical information regarding coding tricks and hardware limitations of older consoles. If you’ve ever been interested to learn even a little about how some of your favorite 16-bit and 32-bit games were made, Gamehut is worth checking out.
