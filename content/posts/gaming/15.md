Since “cutting the cord” somewhere around 8 years ago, I have found that I watch more and more YouTube. I started to figure out after a while that the more you follow and like channels and the better your suggestions became and the more enjoyable your YouTube experience becomes. It seems like common sense, but I was one of those folks who say YouTube as a place to do random searches instead of a place where I could have somewhat curated content show up.
After officially deeming myself a video game collector, I began to have questions like:

- How do I find good deals on games?
- How big of a collection do most collectors have?
- What are some desirable games, hardware, accessories, etc?
- What is the best way to connect old consoles to modern televisions?
- When does <insert game, console, or accessory> come out?
<br><br>
…and many other things.

I turned to YouTube for a lot of those answers at first and learned a lot. I also found that I particularly enjoyed videos from certain creators and I subscribed to their channels. As my feed filled with video game related content, I found more and more YouTubers I liked. My list of video game YouTubers grew enough I thought it might be a good idea to share that list with other collectors who might be interested.

I have decided on a small set of criteria to cover for each YouTuber to have a consistently formatted, brief summary of each channel. The points I will hit are:

- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> This is self explanitory.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> News, top ten lists, reviews, tutorials, etc.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> Hidden gems, getting the best picture from a retro console, how to find good deals, etc.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Could I see myself having a beer with them at a bar or just hanging out playing some video games with them? "Beerable" is a terrible term I picked up from a hiring manager in the tech world, but I decided to use it here regardless of my overall hatred for the term because it is easy an easy to understand concept. This is just personal opinion and based highly off of how well my personality might mesh with their personality and if I think they are they type of person/people for which I could see myself having fun.
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> Again, self explanitory.

## MetalJesusRocks

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEFymXY4eFCo_AchSpxwyrg" target="_blank" rel="external">MetalJesusRocks</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 676,956
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> 1 to 4 times a week
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> MJR’s content varies pretty widely covering subject matter like hidden gems, games top XX lists for consoles, casually playing games or going on adventures with his friends, traveling to see other collectors’ collections, new mods/console/accessories/etc, and more. 
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I’ve honestly sat on my couch with my laptop open taking notes while watching some of his top XX games and hidden gems videos. I seem to have similar tastes in games and his knowledge of game libraries for some consoles runs deep. I also have found value in some of his videos covering new console accessories, cables, etc and have even made purchases based on his coverage.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Absolutely! He likes metal, collects video games, plays guitar, likes to drink and have a good time, and appears to be close to the same age as me.  
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> My only real critique of his channel is that sometimes his videos run a little long for my taste. I tend to consume shorter videos in high quantities and a 30+ minute video isn’t always what I’m seeking, although I do sometimes circle back to those long videos when the timing is right.

## RGT 85

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA5RGaQc-a8tIX_AqTTmWdw" target="_blank" rel="external">RGT 85</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 215,550
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> Daily, sometimes multiple times a day.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Mainly gaming news and reviews, but sometimes he posts other types of content as well.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I mostly get current game news, rumors about upcoming games or consoles, and reviews on modern games and hardware from RGT 85’s channel. We seem reasonably like-minded so if he likes something then I usually know I should dig deeper to see if it is something I would like
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Yup! 
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> I really enjoy RGT 85’s content, but the little nit-pick I have is that he butchers the English language sometimes. It isn’t a huge deal and doesn’t detract from his content, but his misuse of words drives me a little crazy. I know and love lots of people that are not wordsmiths (I might fall into that category with other people), but I always quietly cringe a little when I hear words used incorrectly.﻿

## Spawn Wave

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoIXnB865l9Ex9zs4OIXTdQ" target="_blank" rel="external">Spawn Wave</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 298,268
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> Daily, sometimes multiple times a day.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> Gaming news and rumors, unboxing and reviews on gaming related purchases he makes, and general coverage of modern gaming events. 
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I watch Spawn Wave’s channel a lot mostly to get modern gaming news. He also does videos where he might, for example, by a refurbished console or selection of games from Game Stop then unboxes and takes a dive into what he really received. I find these types of videos useful because he knows the internals and failure points of game hardware well enough to tell you things like “don’t buy a refurbished Xbox 360 from Game Stop” and I use this information when making purchasing decisions.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> I think so, but he just became a father, and as a father myself I can tell you he isn’t going out to have drinks anytime soon (congrats, by the way)! 
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> As with the previous guys, I have no major complaints about Spawn Wave’s channel. If I have to say something it might be that he is a bit too serious or cold in his delivery at times.﻿

## DidYouKnowGaming?

- <b><em>Link to the channel: </em></b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DYKGaming" target="_blank" rel="external">DidYouKnowGaming?</a>
- <b><em>Subscriber count at the time of this writing: </em></b> 2,276,922
- <b><em>How often do they post videos?</em></b> Multiple times a week.
- <b><em>What is the main kind of content they publish?</em></b> History and trivia about retro games, game series, consoles, and more.
- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> I like watching DidYouKnowGaming? because I learn lesser known, interesting facts about all things gaming. I especially enjoyed their whole series on the Zelda franchise.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Being they have different narrators who are presumably reading from a script, I can‘t really say.
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> Big surprise, I don‘t have any real complaints about this channel. If unusual and intersting facts about gaming is what you seek, then you will like this channel. It isn’t as fun as others on the list, but it scratches a different itch.<br><br>

## The 8-bit Guy

- <b><em>What is the type of information I usually learn from their channel?</em></b> The main thing I takeaway from The 8-bit Guy’s videos is knowledge on classic gaming computers. It is a topic for which I have a curiosity and occasionally enjoy learning more about.
- <b><em>Are they “beerable”?</em></b> Maybe?
- <b><em>What are my overall thoughts and critiques of their channel?</em></b> The content is a little dry, but if you want solid information on classic gaming computers then you will find value in this channel.
