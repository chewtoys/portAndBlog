## Notes

I'm in experimental territory considering my experience with Nuxt. I've never used Nuxt and I'm trying some new things here. The idea is to eventually have a really basic portfolio (in the past mine have been WAY to complicated for a site that is rarely visited) and add a blog section. The goal for the blog section is to have it setup where I write markdown files, push to master, Netlify's webhook picks it up and auto builds, and the new blog is posted.

Right now things look a little on the rough side because this is still in active development and, quite frankly, I'm still trying to find design inspiration for some of the views.

## CURRENT FOCUS TODO

- build about section
- style blog posts; my repeating background and gradient is terrible, but is a placeholder until I think of something

## OVERALL TODO

- make it look nicer
- konami code easter egg trigger works, now think of something fun for it to do
- make remaining views
- add more Google Analytics functionality
- add accessibility
- add num of results dropdown to blog lists to allow user to select (not huge priority ATM because of lack of blogs)
