## Notes

I'm in experimental territory, at least for my experience. I've never used Nuxt and I'm trying some new things here. The idea is to eventually have a really basic portfolio (in the past mine have been WAY to complicated for a site that is rarely visited) and add a blog section. The goal for the blog section is to have it setup where I write markdown files, push to master, Netlify's webhook picks it up and auto builds, and the new blog is posted.

Right now a lot of this is garbage code because there is some trial and error happening. I'm just playing around until I iron out some things.

## CURRENT FOCUS TODO
