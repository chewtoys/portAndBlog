## Notes

Right now things look a little on the rough side because this is still in active development and, quite frankly, I'm still trying to find design inspiration for some of the views.

## CURRENT FOCUS TODO

- STYLE! It's kind of chaotic and all over the place. Looks like a toddler designed it. Time to make myself sit down and plan out margins, refine colors, tweak style, etc.
  - I feel like the blog landing, blog section pages, and home screen are ok...for now.
  - The nav is still ugly. The theme switching is neat, but it needs work. Also I want to make it shrink when you scroll down while reading a blog post.
  - The blog posts themselves are plain. I need inspiration here as I've played with some ideas and hated them all.

## OVERALL TODO

- micro data seo stuff
- all the alt tags I can cram into this
- research other useful seo tags
- accessibility
- make it look nicer
- konami code easter egg trigger works, now think of something fun for it to do
- make remaining views
- add more Google Analytics functionality
- add accessibility
- add num of results dropdown to blog lists to allow user to select (not huge priority ATM because of lack of blogs)
