## Notes

Right now things look a little on the rough side because this is still in active development and, quite frankly, I'm still trying to find design inspiration for some of the views.

## CURRENT FOCUS TODO

- STYLE! It's kind of chaotic and all over the place. Looks like a toddler designed it. Time to make myself sit down and plan out margins, refine colors, tweak style, etc.
  - I feel like the blog landing, blog section pages, and home screen are ok...for now.
  - The nav is still ugly. The theme switching is neat, but it needs work (especially the nav icons). Also I want to make it shrink when you scroll down while reading a blog post.
  - The blog posts themselves are plain. I need inspiration here as I've played with some ideas and hated them all.

## OVERALL TODO

- maybe I need a logo? If I decide to do this, I should see about one of those site where you pay a small fee and people take a crack at it?
- make it look nicer
- research other useful seo tags
- add more Google Analytics functionality
- add accessibility
- GDPR? I'm not paying ICO a dime, so maybe I pop up a cookie banner and block the EU from searching my site on Google and Bing?
- the blog sections are eventually going to need pagination, archives, or something because a million posts on the page isn't acceptable
- micro data seo stuff
- konami code easter egg trigger works, now think of something fun for it to do
- make remaining views (My VG library view, gallery of my game collection, and what else if anything?)
